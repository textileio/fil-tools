## Usage

*Warning* This project is still **pre-release** and is only meant for testing.

### Lotus (`lotus`)

See [https://lotu.sh/](https://lotu.sh/). Required for client. Lotus is an implementation of the Filecoin Distributed Storage Networkâ€”we run the Lotus client to join the Filecoin Testnet. 

### Client (`pow`)

```bash
go build -i -o pow exe/cli/main.go 
chmod +x pow 
```

Try `pow --help`.

### Server 
The server connects to Lotus and enables multiple modules, such as:
- Reputations module:
   - Miners index: with on-chain and metadata information.
   - Ask index: with an up-to-date information about available _Storage Ask_ in the network.
   - Slashing index: contains a history of all miner-slashes.
- Deals Module:
    - Contain helper features for making and watching deals.
### Prerequisites
Currently, the server needs the same dependencies as Lotus, so most probably they will be already installed if you run the server in _dev mode_ (`go run` syntax). If that's not the case, [see here](https://docs.lotu.sh/en+install-lotus-ubuntu).

### Run in _dev mode_
The server can be run in _dev mode_ with `go run exe/server/main.go`. 

### Run in _docker mode_
You can run the server in a _Docker Compose_ enviroment with _Prometheus_ and _Grafana_ to have a health-monitoring for the server.
To do so:
```
cd docker
make fresh
```
This will do whatever it takes to get all systems running:
- `localhost:3000`: Grafana dashboard with anonymous setup. _admin_:_foobar_ are  admin credentials.
- `localhost:9090`: Prometheus enpoint.
- `localhost:8888`: Server Prometheus endpoint for metric scraping.
- `localhost:8889`: HTTP endpoint for current index values (`index/miners`, `index/slashing`, `index/ask`).

It's important to mention that the _Docker Compose_ is run in _host_ _network mode_, which is only supported in Linux. Eventually we'll include Lotus inside the compose file allowing for default network modes.

## Test
For running tests: `make test`
