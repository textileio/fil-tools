## Usage

*Warning* This project is still **pre-release** and is only meant for testing.

### Lotus (`lotus`)

See [https://lotu.sh/](https://lotu.sh/). Required for client. Lotus is an implementation of the Filecoin Distributed Storage Network—we run the Lotus client to join the Filecoin Testnet.

### Client (`filcoin`)

Note to developers—as of 1/25/2020, the main line of development for the filecoin client is happening in the `asutula/cli` branch.

```bash
# from the asutula/cli branch
go build -i -o filecoin exe/cli/main.go 
chmod +x filecoin 
```

Try `filecoin --help`.
